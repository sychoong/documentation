      CSS (an abbreviation of Cascading Style Sheets) is the language that we use to style an HTML file, and tell the browser how should it render the elements on the page.

    <h2>SASS And SCSS</h2>
    <p>
      SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCSS is the main syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      SASS and SCSS can import each other. Sass actually makes CSS more powerful with math and variable support.
